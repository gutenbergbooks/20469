PREFACE</a></h4>


<p><span class = "firstword">Of</span> making selections of ballads
there is no end. As a subject for the editor, they seem to be only less
popular than Shakespeare, and every year sees a fresh output. But of
late there has sprung up a custom of confusing the old with the new, the
genuine with the imitation; and the products of civilised days,
‘ballads’ by courtesy or convention, are set beside the rugged and
hard-featured aborigines of the tribe, just as the delicate bust of
Clytie in the British Museum has for next neighbour the rude and bold
‘Unknown Barbarian Captive.’ To contrast by such enforced juxtaposition
a ballad of the golden world with a ballad by Mr. Kipling is unfair to
either, each being excellent in its way; and the collocation of
<i>Edward</i> or <i>Lord Randal</i> with a ballad of Rossetti’s is only
of interest or value as exhibiting the perennial charm of the
<i>refrain</i>.</p>

<p>There exist, however, in our tongue&mdash;though
<span class = "pagenum">x</span>
<a name = "pagex" id = "pagex"> </a>
not only in our tongue&mdash;narratives in rhyme which have been handed
down in oral tradition from father to son for so many ages, that all
record of their authorship has long been lost. These are commonly called
the Old Ballads. Being traditional, each ballad may exist in more than
one form; in most cases the original story is clothed in several
different forms. The present series is designed to include all the best
of these ballads which are still extant in England and Scotland: Ireland
and Wales possess a similar class of popular literature, but each in its
own tongue. It is therefore necessary, in issuing this the first volume
of the series, to say somewhat as to the methods employed in editing and
selecting.</p>

<p>Ballad editors of yore were confronted with perhaps two, perhaps
twenty, versions of each ballad; some unintelligibly fragmentary, some
intelligibly complete; some in print, some in manuscript, some,
perchance, in their own memories. Collating these, they subjected the
text to minute revision, omitting and adding, altering and inserting, to
suit their personal tastes and standards, literary or polite; and having
thus made it over, forgot to record the act, and saw no reason to
apologise therefor.</p>

<p>Pioneers like Thomas Percy, Bishop of Dromore,
<span class = "pagenum">xi</span>
<a name = "pagexi" id = "pagexi"> </a>
and Sir Walter Scott, may well be excused the general censure. The
former, living in and pandering to an age which invented and applied
those delightful literary adjectives ‘elegant’ and ‘ingenious,’ may be
pardoned with the more sincerity if one recalls the influence exercised
on English letters by his publication. The latter, who played the part
of Percy in the matter of Scottish ballads, and was nourished from his
boyhood on the <i>Reliques</i>, printed for the first time many ballads
which still are the best of their class, and was gifted with consummate
skill and taste. Both, moreover, did their work scientifically,
according to their lights; and both have left at least some of their
originals behind them. There is, perhaps, one more exception to the
general condemnation. Of William Allingham’s <i>Ballad Book</i>, as
truly a <i>vade mecum</i> as Palgrave’s lyrical anthology in the same
‘Golden Treasury’ series, I&nbsp;would speak, perhaps only for
sentimental reasons, always with respect, admiring the results of his
editing while looking askance at the method, for he mixed his
ingredients and left no recipe.</p>

<p>But in the majority of cases there is no obvious excuse for this
‘omnium gatherum’ process. The self-imposed function of most ballad
editors appears to have been the compilation
<span class = "pagenum">xii</span>
<a name = "pagexii" id = "pagexii"> </a>
of <i>rifacimenti</i> in accordance with their private ideas of what a
ballad should be. And that such a state of things was permissible is
doubtless an indication of the then prevalent attitude of
half-interested tolerance assumed towards these memorials of
antiquity.</p>

<p>To-day, however, the ballad editor is confronted with the results of
the labours, still unfinished, of a comparatively recent school in
literary science. These have lately culminated in <i>The English and
Scottish Popular Ballads</i>, edited by the late Professor Francis James
Child of Harvard University. This work, in five large volumes, issued in
ten parts at intervals from 1882 to 1898, and left by the editor at his
death complete but for the Introduction&mdash;<i>valde
deflendus</i>&mdash;gives in full all known variants of the three
hundred and five ballads adjudged by its editor to be genuinely
‘popular,’ with an essay, prefixed to each ballad, on its history,
origin, folklore, etc., and notes, glossary, bibliographies, appendices,
etc.; exhibiting as a whole unrivalled special knowledge, great
scholarly intuition, and years of patient research, aided by
correspondents, students, and transcribers in all parts of the world,
Lacking Professor Child’s Introduction, we cannot exactly tell what his
definition of a ‘popular’ ballad was, or what qualities in a ballad
implied
<span class = "pagenum">xiii</span>
<a name = "pagexiii" id = "pagexiii"> </a>
exclusion from his collection&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> he does not admit <i>The
Children in the Wood</i>: otherwise one can find in this monumental work
the whole history and all the versions of nearly all the ballads.</p>

<p>It will be obvious that Professor Child’s academic method is suited
rather to the scholar than the general reader. As a rule, one text of
each ballad is all that is required, which must therefore be
chosen&mdash;but by what rules? To the scholar, it usually happens that
the most ancient and least handled text is the most interesting; but
these are too frequently incomplete and unintelligible. The literary
dilettante may prefer tasteful decorations by a Percy or a Scott;
doubtless Buchan has some admirers: but the student abhors this painting
of the lily.</p>

<p>Therefore I have compromised&mdash;always a dangerous
practice&mdash;and I have sought to give, to the best of my judgement,
<i>that authorised text of each ballad which tells in the best manner
the completest form of the story or plot</i>. I&nbsp;have been forced to
make certain exceptions, but for all departures from the above rule I
have given reasons which, I&nbsp;trust, will be found to justify the
procedure; and in all cases the sources of each text or part of the text
are indicated.</p>

<p>I am quite aware that it may fairly be asked:
<span class = "pagenum">xiv</span>
<a name = "pagexiv" id = "pagexiv"> </a>
Why not assume the immemorial privilege of a ballad editor, and concoct
a text for yourself? Why, when any text of a ballad is, as you admit,
merely a representative of parallel and similar traditional versions,
should you not compile from those other variants a text which should
combine the excellences of each, and give us the cream?</p>

<p>There are several objections to this course. However incompetent,
I&nbsp;should not shrink from the labour involved; nor do I entirely
approve the growing demand for German minuteness and exactitude in
editors. But, firstly, the ballad should be subject to variation only
while it is in oral circulation. Secondly, editorial garnishing has been
overdone already, and my unwillingness to adopt that method is caused as
much by the failure of the majority of editors as by the success of the
few. Lastly, <i>chacun a son goût</i>; there is a kind of literary
selfishness in emending and patching to suit one’s private taste, and,
if any one wishes to do so, he will be most pleased with the result if
he does it for himself.</p>

<p>This lengthy <i>apologia</i> is necessitated by a departure from the
usual custom of ballad-editing. For the rest, my indebtedness to the
work of Professor Child will be obvious throughout. Many of his most
interesting texts were
<span class = "pagenum">xv</span>
<a name = "pagexv" id = "pagexv"> </a>
printed for the first time from manuscripts in private hands. These I
have not sought to collate, which would, indeed, insult his accuracy and
care. But in the case of texts from the Percy Folio, where the labour is
rather to decipher than to transcribe accurately, I&nbsp;have resorted
not only to the reprint of Hales and Furnivall, but to the Folio itself.
The whimsical spelling of this <span class = "smallroman">MS.</span>
pleases me as often as it irritates, and I have ventured in certain
ballads, <i>e.g.</i> <i>Glasgerion</i>, to modernise it, and in others,
<i>e.g.</i> <i>Old Robin of Portingale</i>, to retain it
<i>literatim</i>: in either case I have reduced to uniformity the
orthography of the proper names. Transcripts from other <span class =
"smallroman">MSS.</span> are reproduced as they stand.</p>

<p>In the general Introduction I have tried to sketch the genesis and
history of the ballad impartially in its several aspects, not for
scholars and connoisseurs, but for those ready to learn. To supply
deficiencies, I&nbsp;have added a list of books useful to the student of
English ballads&mdash;to go no further afield. Each ballad also is
prefaced with an introduction setting forth, besides the source of the
text, as succinctly as is consistent with accuracy, the derivation, when
known, of the story; the plot of similar foreign ballads; and points of
interest in folklore, history, or criticism attached to the particular
<span class = "pagenum">xvi</span>
<a name = "pagexvi" id = "pagexvi"> </a>
ballad. Where the story is fragmentary, I&nbsp;have added an argument.
It will be realised that such introductions at the best are but a
thousandth part of what might be written; but if they shall play the
part of <i>hors d’œuvres</i>, and whet the appetite to proceed to more
solid food, the labour will not be lost.</p>

<p>Difficulties in the text are explained in footnotes. Few things are
more vexatious to a reader than constant reference to a glossary; but as
compensation for the educational value thus lost, the footnotes are, to
a certain extent, progressive; that is to say, a&nbsp;word already
explained in a foregoing ballad is not always explained again; and to
the best of my ability I have freed the notes from the grotesque
blunders observable in most modern editions of ballads.</p>

<p>Besides my indebtedness to the books mentioned in the bibliographical
list, I&nbsp;have to acknowledge my thanks to the Rev. Sabine Baring
Gould, for permission to use his version of <i>The Brown Girl</i>; to
Mr. E.&nbsp;K. Chambers, for kindly reading the general Introduction;
and to my friend and partner Mr. A.&nbsp;H. Bullen, for constant
suggestions and assistance.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> old ballads of England and
Scotland are fine wine in cobwebbed bottles; and many have made the
error of paying too much attention to the cobwebs and not enough

<h5 class = "section">I. What is a Ballad?</h5>

<p>The earliest sense of the word ‘ballad,’ or rather of its French and
Provençal predecessors, <i>balada</i>, <i>balade</i> (derived from the
late Latin <i>ballare</i>, to dance), was ‘a song intended as the
accompaniment to a dance,’ a sense long obsolete.<a class = "tag" name =
"tag1" id = "tag1" href = "#note1">1</a> Next came the meaning,
a&nbsp;simple song of sentiment or romance, of two verses or more, each
of which is sung to the same air, the accompaniment being
<span class = "pagenum">xviii</span>
<a name = "pagexviii" id = "pagexviii"> </a>
subordinate to the melody. This sense we still use in our
‘ballad-concerts.’ Another meaning was that of simply a popular song or
ditty of the day, lyrical or narrative, of the kind often printed as a
broadsheet. Lyrical <i>or</i> narrative, because the Elizabethans appear
not to distinguish the two. Read, for instance, the well-known scene in
<i>The Winter’s Tale</i> (Act <span class = "smallroman">IV.</span>
Sc.&nbsp;4); here we have both the lyrical ballad, as sung by Dorcas and
Mopsa, in which Autolycus bears his part ‘because it is his occupation’;
and also the ‘ballad in print,’ which Mopsa says she loves&mdash;‘for
then we are sure it is true.’ Immediately after, however, we discover
that the ‘ballad in print’ is the broadside, the narrative ballad, sung
of a usurer’s wife brought to bed of twenty money-bags at a burden, or
of a fish that appeared upon the coast on Wednesday the fourscore of
April: in short, as <i>Martin Mar-sixtus</i> says (1592), ‘scarce a cat
can look out of a gutter but out starts a halfpenny chronicler, and
presently a proper new ballet of a strange sight is indited.’ Chief
amongst these ‘halfpenny chroniclers’ were William Elderton, of whom
Camden records that he ‘did arm himself with ale (as old father Ennius
did with wine) when he ballated,’ and thereby obtained a red nose almost
as celebrated as his verses; Thomas Deloney, ‘the ballating silkweaver
of Norwich’; and Richard Johnson, maker of Garlands. Thus to Milton, to
Addison, and even to Johnson, ‘ballad’ essentially implies singing; but
from about the middle of the
<span class = "pagenum">xix</span>
<a name = "pagexix" id = "pagexix"> </a>
eighteenth century the modern interpretation of the word began to come
into general use.</p>

<p>In 1783, in one of his letters, the poet Cowper says: ‘The ballad is
a species of poetry, I&nbsp;believe, peculiar to this country....
Simplicity and ease are its proper characteristics.’ Here we have one of
the earliest attempts to define the modern meaning of a ‘ballad.’
Centuries of use and misuse of the word have left us no unequivocal name
for the ballad, and we are forced to qualify it with epithets.
‘Traditional’ might be deemed sufficient; but ‘popular’ or ‘communal’ is
more definite. Here we adopt the word used by Professor
Child&mdash;‘popular.’</p>

<p>What, then, do we intend to signify by the expression ‘popular
ballads’? Far the most important point is to maintain an antithesis
between the poetry of the people and the consciously artistic poetry of
the schools. Wilhelm Grimm, the less didactic of the two famous
brothers, said that the ballad says nothing unnecessary or unreal, and
despises external adornment. Ferdinand Wolf, the great critic of the
Homeric question, said the ballad must be naïve, objective, not
sentimental, lively and erratic in its narrative, without ornamentation,
yet with much picturesque vigour.</p>

<p>It is even more necessary to define sharply the line between poetry
<i>of</i> the people and poetry <i>for</i> the people.<a class = "tag"
name = "tag2" id = "tag2" href = "#note2">2</a> The latter may still be
written;
<span class = "pagenum">xx</span>
<a name = "pagexx" id = "pagexx"> </a>
the making of the former is a lost art. Poetry of the people is either
lyric or narrative. This difference is roughly that between song and
ballad. ‘With us,’ says Ritson, ‘songs of sentiment, expression, or even
description, are properly termed songs, in contradistinction to mere
narrative compositions which we now denominate Ballads.’ This
definition, of course, is essentially modern; we must still insist on
the fact that genuine ballads were sung: ‘I sing Musgrove,’<a class =
"tag" name = "tag3" id = "tag3" href = "#note3">3</a> says Sir Thwack in
Davenant’s <i>The Wits</i>, ‘and for the Chevy Chase no lark comes near
me.’ Lastly, we must emphasise that the accompaniment is predominated by
the air to which the words are sung. I&nbsp;have heard the modern comic
song described as ‘the kind in which you hear the words,’ thus
differentiating it from the drawing-room song, in which the words are
(happily) as a rule less audible than the melody. In the ballad, as
sung, the words are most important; but it is of vital importance to
remember that the ballads were chanted.</p>


<h5 class = "section">II. Poetry of the People.</h5>

<p>Now what is this ‘poetry of the people’? One theory is as follows.
Every nation or people in the natural course of its development reaches
a stage at which it consists of a homogeneous, compact community, with
its sentiments
<span class = "pagenum">xxi</span>
<a name = "pagexxi" id = "pagexxi"> </a>
undivided by class-distinctions, so that the whole active body forms
what is practically an individual. Begging the question, that poetry can
be produced by such a body, this poetry is naturally of a concrete and
narrative character, and is previous to the poetry of art. ‘Therefore,’
says Professor Child, ‘while each ballad will be idiosyncratic, it will
not be an expression of the personality of individuals, but of a
collective sympathy; and the fundamental characteristic of popular
ballads is therefore the absence of subjectivity and self-consciousness.
Though they do not “write themselves,” as Wilhelm Grimm has
said&mdash;though a man and not a people has composed them, still the
author counts for nothing, and it is not by mere accident, but with the
best reason, that they have come down to us anonymous.’</p>

<p>By stating this, the dictum of one of the latest and most erudite of
ballad-scholars, so early in our argument, we anticipate a century or
more of criticism and counter-criticism, during which the giants of
literature ranged themselves in two parties, and instituted a
battle-royal which even now is not quite finished. It will be most
convenient if we denominate the one party as that which holds to the
communal or ‘nebular’ theory of authorship, and the other as the
anti-communal or ‘artistic’ theory. The tenet of the former party has
already been set forth, namely, that the poetry of the people is a
natural and spontaneous production of a community at that stage
<span class = "pagenum">xxii</span>
<a name = "pagexxii" id = "pagexxii"> </a>
of its existence when it is for all practical purposes an individual.
The theory of the ‘artistic’ school is that the ballads and folk-songs
are the productions of skalds, minstrels, bards, troubadours, or other
vagrant professional singers and reciters of various periods; it is
allowed, however, that, being subject entirely to oral transmission,
these ballads and songs are open to endless variation.</p>

<p>On the Continent, Herder was pioneer, both of the claims of popular
poetry and of the nebular theory of authorship. Traditions of chivalry,
he says, became poetry in the mouths of the people; but his definition
of popular poetry has rather extended bounds. Herder’s enthusiasm fired
Goethe (who, however, did not wholly accede to the ‘nebular’ theory) to
study the subject, and the effect was soon noticeable in his own poetry.
Next came the two great brothers, whose names are ever to be held in
honour wherever folklore is studied or folktales read, Jacob and Wilhelm
Grimm. Jacob, the more ardent and polemical, insisted on the communal
authorship of the poetry of the people; ballad or song ‘sings
itself.’</p>

<p>Both the Grimms, and especially Jacob, were severely handled by the
critic Schlegel, who insisted on the artist. To Schlegel we owe the
famous image in which popular poetry is a tower, and the poet an
architect. Hundreds may fetch and carry, but all are useless without the
direction of the architect. This is specious argument;
<span class = "pagenum">xxiii</span>
<a name = "pagexxiii" id = "pagexxiii"> </a>
but we might reply to Schlegel that an architect is only wanted when the
result is required to be an artistic whole. The tower of Babel was built
by hundreds of men under no superintendence. Schlegel’s intention,
however, is no less clear than that of Jacob Grimm, and the two are
diametrically opposed.</p>

<p>In England, literary prejudice against the unpolished barbarities and
uncouthnesses of the ballad was at no time so pronounced as it was on
the Continent, and especially in Germany, during the latter half of the
eighteenth century. Indeed, at intervals, the most learned and fantastic
critics in England would call attention to the poetry of the people. Sir
Philip Sidney’s apologetic words are well known:&mdash; ‘Certainly I
must confesse my own barbarousnes, I&nbsp;never heard the olde song of
<i>Percy</i> and <i>Duglas</i>, that I found not my heart mooved more
then with a Trumpet.’ Addison was bolder. ‘It is impossible that
anything should be universally tasted and approved by a Multitude, tho’
they are only the Rabble of a Nation, which hath not in it some peculiar
Aptness to please and gratify the Mind of Man.’ With these and other
encouragements the popular poetry of England was not lost to sight; and
in 1765 the work of the good Bishop of Dromore gave the ballads a place
in literature.</p>

<p>Percy’s opening remarks, attributing the ballads to the minstrels,
are as well known as the scoffs of the hard-hitting Joseph Ritson, who
<span class = "pagenum">xxiv</span>
<a name = "pagexxiv" id = "pagexxiv"> </a>
contemptuously dismissed Percy’s theories,<a class = "tag" name = "tag4"
id = "tag4" href = "#note4">4</a> and refused to believe any ballad to
be of earlier origin than the reign of Elizabeth. Sir Walter Scott was
quite ready to accept the ballads as the productions of the minstrels,
either as ‘the occasional effusions of some self-taught bard,’ or as
abridged from the tales of tradition after the days when, as Alfred de
Musset says, ‘our old romances spread their wings of gold towards the
enchanted world.’</p>

<p>This brings us nearer to our own day. The argument is not closed,
although we can discern offers of concession from either side. Svend
Grundtvig, editor of the enormous collection of Danish ballads,
distinguished the ballad from all forms of artistic literature, and
would have the artist left out of sight; Nyrop and the Scandinavian
scholars, on the other hand, entirely gave up the notion of communal
authorship. Howbeit, the trend of modern criticism,<a class = "tag" name
= "tag5" id = "tag5" href = "#note5">5</a> on the whole, is towards a
common belief regarding most ballads, which may be stated again, in
Professor Child’s words: ‘Though a man and not a people has composed
them, still the author counts for nothing, and it is not by mere
accident, but with the best reason, that they have come down to us
anonymous.’</p>


<span class = "pagenum">xxv</span>
<a name = "pagexxv" id = "pagexxv"> </a>
<h5 class = "section">III. The Growth of Ballads.</h5>

<p>Let us then picture, however vaguely and uncertainly, the growth of a
ballad. It is well known that the folklores of the various races of the
world exhibit common features, and that the beliefs, superstitions,
tales, even conventionalities of expression, of one race, are found to
present constant and remarkable similarities to those of another.
Whether these similarities are to be held mere coincidences, or whether
they are to be explained by the theory of a common ancestry in the
cradle of the world, is a side-issue into which I do not intend to
enter. Suffice it that the fact is true, especially of the peoples who
speak the Indo-European tongues. The lore which has for its foundation
permanent and universal acceptance in the hearts of mankind is preserved
by tradition, and remains independent of the criteria applied
instinctively and unconsciously to artistic compositions. The community
is one at heart, one in mind, one in method of expression. Tales are
recited, verses chanted, and the singer of a clan makes his version of a
popular story. Simultaneously other singers, it may be of other clans of
the same race, or of another race altogether, elaborate their versions
of the common theme. Meanwhile the first singer has again recited or
chanted his ballad, and, having forgotten the exact wording, has altered
it, and perhaps introduced improvements. The same happens in the other
cases.
<span class = "pagenum">xxvi</span>
<a name = "pagexxvi" id = "pagexxvi"> </a>
The various audiences carry away as much as they can remember, and
recite their versions, again with individual omissions, alterations, and
additions. Thus, by ever-widening circles, the tale is distributed in
countless forms over an unlimited area. The elements of the story
remain, wholly or in part, while the literary clothing is altered
according to the ‘taste and fancy’ of the reciter. The lore is now
traditional, whether it be in prose, as Märchen, or in verse, as ballad.
And so it remains in oral circulation&mdash;and therefore still liable
to variation&mdash;until it is written down or printed. It is left
‘masterless,’ unsigned; for of the original author’s composition, may
be, only a word or two remains. It has passed through many mouths, and
has been made over countless times. But once written down it ceases
<i>virûm volitare per ora</i>; the invention of printing has spoiled the
powers of man’s memory.</p>

<p>We can now take up the tale at the fifteenth century; let us
henceforth confine our attention to England. It is agreed on all sides
that the fifteenth century was the period when, in England at least, the
ballads first became a prominent feature. Of historical ballads, <i>The
Hunting of the Cheviot</i> was probably composed as early as 1400 or
thereabouts. The romances contemporaneously underwent a change, and took
on a form nearer to that of the ballad. Whatever may be the date of the
origin of the subject-matter, the literary clothing&mdash;language, mode
of expression, colour&mdash;of no ballad, as we
<span class = "pagenum">xxvii</span>
<a name = "pagexxvii" id = "pagexxvii"> </a>
now have it, is much, earlier than 1400. The only possible exceptions to
this statement are one or two of the Robin Hood ballads&mdash;attributed
to the thirteenth century by Professor Child, but <i>adhuc sub
judice</i>&mdash;and a ballad of sacred
legend&mdash;<i>Judas</i>&mdash;which exists in a thirteenth-century
manuscript in the library of Trinity College, Cambridge.</p>

<p>During the fifteenth century, the ballads, still purely narrative,
were cast abroad through the length and breadth of the land, undergoing
continual changes, modifications, enlargements, for better or for worse.
They told of romance and chivalry, of historical, quasi-historical, and
mythico-historical deeds, of the traditions of the Church and sacred
legend, and of the lore that gathers round the most popular of heroes,
Robin Hood. The earliest printed English ballad is the <i>Gest of Robyn
Hode</i>, which now remains in a fragment of about the end of the
fifteenth century.</p>

<p>The sixteenth century continued the process of the popularisation of
ballads. Minstrels, who, as a class, had been slowly perishing ever
since the invention of printing, were now vagrants, and the profession
was decadent. Towards the end of the century we hear of Richard Sheale,
whom we may describe as the first of the so-called ‘Last of the
Minstrels.’ He describes himself as a minstrel of Tamworth, his business
being to chant ballads and tell tales. We know that the ballad of <i>The
Hunting of the Cheviot</i> was
<span class = "pagenum">xxviii</span>
<a name = "pagexxviii" id = "pagexxviii"> </a>
part of his repertory, for he wrote down his version, which is still
preserved in the Ashmolean <span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span> At the
end of the sixteenth century the minstrels had fallen, in England at
least, into entire degradation. In 1597, Percy notes, a&nbsp;statute of
Elizabeth was passed including ‘minstrels, wandering abroad,’ amongst
the other ‘rogues, vagabonds, and sturdy beggars’; and fifty years later
Cromwell made a very similar ordinance.<a class = "tag" name = "tag6" id
= "tag6" href = "#note6">6</a></p>

<p>In Elizabeth’s reign we first meet with the ballad-mongers and
professional authors of ballads. Simultaneously, or nearly so, comes the
degradation of the word ‘ballad,’ until it signifies either the genuine
popular ballad, or a satirical song, or a broadside, or almost any ditty
of the day. Of the ballad-mongers, we have mentioned Elderton, Deloney,
and Johnson. We might add a hundred others, from Anthony Munday to
Martin Parker, and even Tom Durfey, each of whom contributed largely to
the vast mushroom-literature that sprang up and flourished vigorously
for the next century. Chappell mentions that seven hundred and
ninety-six ballads remained at the end of 1560 in the cupboards of the
council-chamber of the Stationers’ Company for transference to the new
wardens of the succeeding year. These, of course, would consist chiefly
of broadsides: the narrations of strange events, monstrosities, or ‘true
tales’ of the day.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">xxix</span>
<a name = "pagexxix" id = "pagexxix"> </a>
It is true that many of the genuine popular ballads were rewritten to
suit contemporary taste. But the style of the seventeenth century
ballads cannot be compared to the noble straightforwardness and
simplicity of the ancient ballad. Let us place side by side the first
stanza of the <i>Hunting of the Cheviot</i> and the first few verses of
<i>Fair Rosamond</i>, a&nbsp;very fair specimen of Deloney’s work.</p>

<p>The popular ancient ballad wastes no time on preliminaries<a class =
"tag" name = "tag7" id = "tag7" href = "#note7">7</a>:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "poem intro">

</div>

<p>Now for the milk-and-water:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "poem intro">
<p>‘Whenas King Henry rulde this land,</p>

</div>

<p><span class = "pagenum">xxx</span>
<a name = "pagexxx" id = "pagexxx"> </a>
Ritson’s taste actually led him, in comparing the above two first
verses, to prefer the latter.</p>

<p>Or again we might contrast <i>Sir Patrick Spence</i>&mdash;</p>

<div class = "poem intro">
<p>‘The King sits in Dumferling towne</p>

<p class = "inset">These wordes, which I shall write;</p>

</div>

<p>Artificial, tedious, didactic. The author of the ancient ballad
seldom points, and never draws, a&nbsp;moral, and has unbounded faith in
the credulity of the audience. The seventeenth century balladists
pitchforked Nature into the midden.</p>

<p>These compositions were printed as soon as written, or, to be exact,
they were written for the press. We now class them as broadsides, that
is, ballads printed on one side of the paper. The difference between
these and the true ballad is the difference between art and nature. The
broadside ballad was a form of art, and a low form of art. They were
written by hacks for the press, sold in the streets, and pasted on the
walls of houses or rooms: Jamieson had a copy of <i>Young Beichan</i>
which he picked off a wall in Piccadilly. They were generally ornamented
with crude woodcuts, remarkable for their artistic shortcomings and
infidelity to nature.

Dr. Johnson’s well-known lines&mdash;though in fact a caricature of
Percy’s <i>Hermit of Warkworth</i>&mdash;ingeniously parody their
style:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "inset">I walk’d along the Strand,</p>
<p>I there did meet another man,</p>
<p class = "inset">With his hat in his hand.’</p>
</div>

<p>Broadside ballads, including a few of the genuine ancient ballads,
still enjoy a certain popularity. The once-famous Catnach Press still
survives in Seven Dials, and Mr. Such, of Union Street in the Borough,
still maintains what is probably the largest stock of broadsides now in
existence, including <i>Lady Isabel and the Elf Knight</i> (or <i>May
Colvin</i>), perhaps the most widely dispersed ballad of any.</p>

<p>Minstrels of all sorts were by this time nearly extinct, in person if
not in name; their successors were the vendors of broadsides.
Nevertheless, survivors of the genuine itinerant reciters of ballads
have been discovered at intervals almost to the present day. Sir Walter
Scott mentions a person who ‘acquired the name of Roswal and Lillian,
from singing that romance about the streets of Edinburgh’ in 1770 or
thereabouts. He further alludes to ‘John Graeme, of Sowport in
Cumberland, commonly called the Long Quaker, very lately alive.’ Ritson
mentions a minstrel of Derbyshire, and another from Gloucester, who
chanted the ballad of <i>Lord Thomas and Fair Eleanor</i>. In 1845
J.&nbsp;H. Dixon wrote of several men he had met, chiefly Yorkshire
dalesmen,
<span class = "pagenum">xxxii</span>
<a name = "pagexxxii" id = "pagexxxii"> </a>
not vagrants, but with a local habitation, who at Christmas-tide would
sing the old ballads. One of these was Francis King, known then
throughout the western dales of Yorkshire, and still remembered, as ‘the
Skipton Minstrel.’ After a merry Christmas meeting, in the year 1844, he
walked into the river near Gargrave, in Craven, and was drowned. In
Gargrave church-yard lie the remains of perhaps the actual ‘last of the
minstrels.’<a class = "tag" name = "tag8" id = "tag8" href =
"#note8">8</a></p>


<h5 class = "section">IV. Collectors and Editors.</h5>

<p>Now a word or two as to the collectors and editors. To take the
broadsides first, the largest collections are at Magdalene College,
Cambridge (eighteen hundred broadsides collected by Selden and Pepys),
in the Bodleian at Oxford, and in the British Museum. The Bodleian
contains collections made by Anthony-à-Wood, Douce, and Rawlinson; the
British Museum, the great Roxburghe and Bagford collections, which have
been reprinted and edited by William Chappell and the Rev. J.&nbsp;W.
Ebsworth for the Ballad Society, as well as other smaller volumes of
ballads.</p>

<p>But it is not among the broadsides that our
<span class = "pagenum">xxxiii</span>
<a name = "pagexxxiii" id = "pagexxxiii"> </a>
noblest ballads are found. The first attempt to collect popular ballads
was made by the compiler of three volumes issued in 1723 and 1725. The
editor is said to have been Ambrose Phillips, whose name and style
combined to produce the word ‘namby-pamby.’ Next came Allan Ramsay, with
‘the <i>Evergreen</i>, a&nbsp;collection of Scots poems wrote by the
ingenious before 1600.’&mdash;‘By the ingenious,’ we note; not by the
‘elegant.’ The tide is already beginning to turn; pitch-forked Nature
will ever come back. Followed the <i>Tea-Table Miscellany</i>, also
compiled by Allan Ramsay, which contained about twenty popular ballads,
the rest being songs and ballads of modern composition. The texts were,
of course, chopped about and pruned to suit contemporary taste. It was
still necessary to adopt an apologetic attitude on behalf of these
barbarous and crude relics of antiquity.</p>

<p>These books paved the way to the great literary triumph of the
century. The first edition of Percy’s <i>Reliques</i> was issued in
three volumes, in 1765. He received for it one hundred guineas, instant
popularity and patronage, and subsequently, the gratitude of succeeding
centuries.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Percy himself was so far under the influence of his
contemporaries that he felt it necessary to adopt the apologetic
attitude. In his preface he wrote:&mdash; ‘In a polished age like the
present, I&nbsp;am sensible that many of these reliques of antiquity
will require great allowances
<span class = "pagenum">xxxiv</span>
<a name = "pagexxxiv" id = "pagexxxiv"> </a>
to be made for them.’ And again:&mdash; ‘To atone for the rudeness of
the more obsolete poems, each volume concludes with a few modern
attempts in the same kind of writing; and to take off from the
tediousness of the longer narratives, they are everywhere intermingled
with little elegant pieces of the lyrical kind.’ In short, he could not
trust that large child, the people of England, to take its dose of
powder without the conventional treacle. To vary the metaphor, his
famous Folio Manuscript he regarded as a Cinderella, and in his capacity
as fairy godmother refused to introduce her to the world without hiding
the slut’s uncouth attire under fine raiment. To which end, besides
adding ‘little elegant pieces,’ he recast and rewrote ‘the more obsolete
poems,’ many of which came direct from the Folio Manuscript. Are we to
blame him for yielding to the taste of his day?</p>

<p>He did not satisfy every one. Ritson’s immediate outcry is
famous&mdash;and Ritson stood almost alone. He did, indeed, go so far as
to deny the existence of the Folio Manuscript, and Percy was forced to
confute him by producing it. In the later editions of the
<i>Reliques</i>, Percy sought to conciliate him by revising his texts,
so as to approximate them more closely to his originals, but still
Ritson cried out for the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. And by
this time he had supporters. But the whole truth as regards the Folio
was not to be divulged yet. The manuscript was most jealously
guarded.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">xxxv</span>
<a name = "pagexxxv" id = "pagexxxv"> </a>
Meanwhile the influence of the publication was having its effect. The
poetry of the schools, the poetry of the intellect, the poetry of art,
brought to its highest pitch by writers like Dryden and Pope, was
shelved; metrically exact diction, artificiality of expression,
carefully balanced antitheses, <ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads ‘aud’">and</ins> all the mechanical devices of the school were
placed in abeyance. There was a general return to Nature, to simplicity,
to straightforwardness&mdash;not without imagination, however.
Wordsworth, besides insisting, in a famous passage, the Preface to the
<i>Lyrical Ballads</i>, on the spontaneity of good poetry, recorded his
tribute to the <i>Reliques</i>: ‘I do not think that there is an able
writer in verse of the present day who would not be proud to acknowledge
his obligation to the <i>Reliques</i>.’ While failing often to catch the
gusto of ancient poetry&mdash;witness his translations from
Chaucer&mdash;Wordsworth was full of the spirit&mdash;witness his
rifacimento of <i>The Owl and the Nightingale</i>&mdash;and, best of
all, handed it on to Coleridge.<a class = "tag" name = "tag9" id =
"tag9" href = "#note9">9</a> These two fought side by side against the
conventions of the preceding century, against Dryden, Addison, Pope, and
last, but not least, Johnson. Some have gone so far as to place the
definite turning-point in the year 1798, the year
<span class = "pagenum">xxxvi</span>
<a name = "pagexxxvi" id = "pagexxxvi"> </a>
of the publication of the <i>Lyrical Ballads</i>. <ins class =
"correction" title = "invisible hyphen at line break">Coleridge’s</ins>
<i>annus mirabilis</i> was 1797, and the publication of <i>The Ancient
Mariner</i> is significant of the change. But we need not bind ourselves
down to any given year. Enough that the revolution was effected, and
that it is scarcely exaggeration to say that it was almost entirely due
to the publication of the <i>Reliques</i>.</p>

<p>Sir Walter Scott remembered to the day of his death the place where
he first made acquaintance with the <i>Reliques</i> in his thirteenth
year. ‘I remember well the spot where I read those volumes for the first
time. It was beneath a large platanus-tree, in the ruins of what had
been intended for an old-fashioned arbour in the garden I have
mentioned. The summer day sped onward so fast, that, notwithstanding the
sharp appetite of thirteen, I&nbsp;forgot the hour of dinner, was sought
for with anxiety, and was still found entranced in my intellectual
banquet.’</p>

<p>Almost immediately competitors appeared in the field, and especial
attention was given to Scotland, exceedingly rich ground, as it proved.
In 1769, David Herd published his collection of <i>Ancient and Modern
Scots Songs, Heroic Ballads, etc.</i> Then, at intervals of two or three
years only, came the compilations of Evans, Pinkerton, Ritson, Johnson;
in 1802 Sir Walter Scott’s <i>Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</i>, fit
to be placed side by side with the <i>Reliques</i>; in 1806 Jamieson’s
<i>Popular Ballads and Songs</i>; then Finlay, Gilchrist, Laing, and
Utterson. In 1828 the
<span class = "pagenum">xxxvii</span>
<a name = "pagexxxvii" id = "pagexxxvii"> </a>
egregious Peter Buchan produced <i>Ancient Ballads and Songs of the
North of Scotland, hitherto unpublished</i>. Buchan hints that he kept a
pedlar or beggarman&mdash;‘a wight of Homer’s craft’&mdash;travelling
through Scotland to pick up ballads; and one of the two&mdash;probably
Buchan&mdash;must have been possessed of powerful inventive faculties.
Each of Buchan’s ballads is tediously spun out to enormous and
unnecessary length, and is filled with solecisms and inanities quite
inconsistent with the spirit of the true ballad. But Buchan undoubtedly
gained fresh material, however much he clothed it; and his ballads are
now reprinted, as Professor Child says, for much the same reason that
thieves are photographed.</p>

<p>Scotland continued the work with two excellent students and pioneers,
George Kinloch and William Motherwell. Next, Robert Chambers published a
collection of eighty ballads, some being spurious. This was in 1829.
Thirty years later Chambers came to the conclusion that ‘the high-class
romantic ballads of Scotland ... are not older than the early part of
the eighteenth century, and are mainly, if not wholly, the production of
one mind.’ And this one mind, he thinks, was probably that of Elizabeth,
Lady Wardlaw, the acknowledged forger of the ballad <i>Hardyknute</i>,
which deceived so many. Chambers, of course, was absurdly mistaken.</p>

<p>So the work of collecting and editing progressed through the
nineteenth century, till it culminated in the final edition of Professor
Child’s <i>English</i>
<span class = "pagenum">xxxviii</span>
<a name = "pagexxxviii" id = "pagexxxviii"> </a>
<i>and Scottish Popular Ballads</i>. But even this is scarcely his
greatest benefaction to the study of ballads. We must confess that had
it not been for the insistence of this American scholar, the Percy Folio
Manuscript would remain a sealed book. For six years Professor Child
persecuted Dr. Furnivall, who persecuted in turn the owners of the
Folio, even offering sums of money, for permission to print the <span
class = "smallroman">MS.</span> Eventually they succeeded, and not only
succeeded in giving to the world an exact reprint,<a class = "tag" name
= "tag10" id = "tag10" href = "#note10">10</a> but also once for all
secured the precious original for the British Museum, where it now
remains.<a class = "tag" name = "tag11" id = "tag11" href =
"#note11">11</a></p>

<p>And what is this manuscript? In brief, it is an example of the
commonplace books which abounded in the seventeenth century. But it is
unique in containing a large proportion of early romances and ballads,
as well as the lyrics of the day. Of the hundreds of commonplace books
made during that century, no other example is known which contains such
matter, for the obvious and simple reason that such matter was
despised.<a class = "tag" name = "tag12" id = "tag12" href =
"#note12">12</a> The handwriting is put by experts at about 1650; it
cannot be much later, and one song in it contains a passage which fixes
the date of that song
<span class = "pagenum">xxxix</span>
<a name = "pagexxxix" id = "pagexxxix"> </a>
to the year 1643. Percy discovered the book ‘lying dirty on the floor
under a bureau in the parlour’ of his friend Humphrey Pitt of Shifnal,
in Shropshire<ins class = "correction" title = "text has extra close quote">,
</ins>‘being used by maids to light the fire.’ Mr. Pitt’s fires
were lighted with half-pages torn out from incomparably early and
precious versions of certain Robin Hood and other ballads. Percy notes
that he was very young when he first got possession of the <span class =
"smallroman">MS.</span>, and had not then learned to reverence it. When
he put it into boards to lend to Dr. Johnson, the bookbinder pared the
margins, and cut away top and bottom lines. In editing the
<i>Reliques</i>, Percy actually tore out pages ‘to save the trouble of
transcribing.’ In spite of all, it remains a unique and inestimably
valuable manuscript. Its writer was presumably a Lancashire man, from
his use of certain dialect words, and was assuredly a man of slight
education; nevertheless a national benefactor.</p>

<p>In speaking of manuscripts, we must not omit to mention the Scottish
collectors. Most of them went to work in the right way, seeking out aged
men and women in out-of-the-way corners of Scotland, and taking down
their ballads from their lips. If we condemn these editors for
subsequently adorning the traditional versions, we must be grateful to
them for preserving their manuscripts so that we can still read the
ballads as they received them. The old ladies of Scotland seem to have
possessed better memories than the old men. Besides Sir Walter Scott’s
anonymous ‘Old Lady,’ there was another to
<span class = "pagenum">xl</span>
<a name = "pagexl" id = "pagexl"> </a>
whom we owe some of the finest versions of the Scottish ballads. This
was Mrs. Brown, daughter of Professor Gordon of Aberdeen. Born in 1747,
she learned most of her ballads before she was twelve years old, or
before 1759, from the singing of her aunt, Mrs. Farquhar of Braemar.
From about twenty to forty years later, she repeated her ballads, first
to Jamieson, and afterwards to William Tytler, each of whom compiled a
manuscript. The latter, the Tytler-Brown <span class =
"smallroman">MS.</span>, unfortunately is lost, but the ballads are
practically all known from the other manuscript and various sources.</p>

<p>Perhaps the richest part of our stock are the Scottish and Border
ballads. Beside them, most of our mawkish English ballads look pale and
withered. The reason, perhaps, may be traced to the effect of natural
surroundings on literature. The English ballads were printed or written
down at a period which is early compared with the date of collection of
the Scottish ballads. In fact, it is only during the last hundred and
thirty years that the ballads of Scotland have been recovered from oral
tradition. In mountainous districts, where means of communication and
intercourse are naturally limited, tradition dies more hard than in
countries where there are no such barriers. Moreover, as Professor Child
points out, ‘oral transmission by the unlettered is not to be feared
nearly so much as by minstrels, nor by minstrels nearly so much as
modern editors.’ Svend Grundtvig illustrates this from his
<span class = "pagenum">xli</span>
<a name = "pagexli" id = "pagexli"> </a>
twenty-nine versions of the Danish ballad ‘Ribold and Guldborg.’ In
versions from recitation, he has shown that there occur certain verses
which have never been printed, but which are found in old manuscripts;
and these recited versions also contain verses which have never been
either printed or written down in Danish, but which are to be found
still in recitation, not only in Norwegian and Swedish versions, but
even in Icelandic tradition of two hundred years’ standing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Such, then, is the history of our ballads, so far as it may be stated
in a few pages. With regard to origins, the ‘nebular’ theory cannot be
summarily dismissed;<a class = "tag" name = "tag13" id = "tag13" href =
"#note13">13</a> but, after weighing the evidence and arguments, the
balance of probability would seem to lie with the supporters of the
‘artistic’ theory in a modified form. The ballad may say, with Topsy,
‘Spec’s I growed’; but <i>vires adquirit eundo</i> is only true of the
ballad to a certain point; progress, which includes the invention of
printing and the absorption into cities of the unsophisticated rural
population, has since killed the oral circulation of the ballad. Thus it
was not an unmixed evil that in the Middle Ages, as a rule, the ballads
were neglected; for this neglect, while it rendered the discovery of
their sources almost impossible, gave the ballads for a time into the
safe-keeping
<span class = "pagenum">xlii</span>
<a name = "pagexlii" id = "pagexlii"> </a>
of their natural possessors, the common people. Civilisation, advancing
more swiftly in some countries than in others, has left rich stores
here, and little there. Our close kinsmen of Denmark, and the rest of
Scandinavia, possess a ballad-literature of which they do well to be
proud; and Spain is said to have inherited even better legacies.
A&nbsp;study of our native ballads yields much interest, much delight,
and much regret that the gleaning is comparatively so small. But what we
still have is of immense value. The ballads may not be required again to
revoke English literature from flights into artificiality and
subjectivity; but they form a leaf in the life of the English people,
they uphold the dignity of human nature, they carry us away to the
legends, the romances, the beliefs, the traditions of our ancestors, and
take us out of ourselves to ‘fleet the time carelessly, as they did in
the golden world.’</p>

BALLADS IN THE FIRST SERIES</a></h4>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> only possible method of
classifying ballads is by their subject-matter; and even thus the lines
of demarcation are frequently blurred. It is, however, possible to
divide them roughly into several main classes, such as ballads of
romance and chivalry; ballads of superstition and of the supernatural;
Arthurian, historical, sacred, domestic ballads; ballads of Robin Hood
and other outlaws; and so forth.</p>

<p>The present volume is concerned with ballads of romance and chivalry;
but it is useless to press too far the appropriateness of this title.
<i>The Nutbrown Maid</i>, for instance, is not a true ballad at all, but
an amœbæan idyll, or dramatic lyric. But, on the whole, these ballads
chiefly tell of life, love, death, and human passions, of revenge and
murder and heroic deed.</p>

<div class = "poem intro">
<p class = "inset6">‘These things are life:</p>
<p>And life, some think, is worthy of the Muse.’</p>
</div>

<p>They are left unexpurgated, as they came down to us: to apologise for
things now left unsaid would be to apologise not only for the heroic
epoch in which they were born, but also for human nature.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">xliv</span>
<a name = "pagexliv" id = "pagexliv"> </a>
And how full of life that heroic epoch was! Of what stature must Lord
William’s steed have been, if Lady Maisry could hear him sneeze a mile
away! How chivalrous of Gawaine to wed an ugly bride to save his king’s
promise, and how romantic and delightful to discover her on the morrow
to have changed into a well-fared may!</p>

<p>The popular Muse regards not probability. Old Robin, who hails from
Portugal, marries the daughter of the mayor of Linne, that unknown town
so dear to ballads. In <i>Young Bekie</i>, Burd Isbel’s heart is
wondrous sair to find, on liberating her lover, that the bold rats and
mice have eaten his yellow hair. We must not think of objecting that the
boldest rat would never eat a live prisoner’s hair, but only applaud the
picturesque indication of durance vile.</p>

<p>In the same ballad, Burd Isbel, ‘to keep her from thinking
lang’&mdash;a&nbsp;prevalent complaint&mdash;is told to take ‘twa marys’
on her journey. We suddenly realise how little there was to amuse the
Burd Isbels of yore. Twa marys provide a week’s diversion. Otherwise her
only occupation would have been to kemb her golden hair, or perhaps,
like Fair Annie, drink wan water to preserve her complexion.</p>

<p>But if their occupations were few, their emotions and affections were
strong. Ellen endures insult after insult from Child Waters with the
faithful patience of a Griselda. Hector the hound recognises Burd Isbel
after years of separation. Was any lord or lady in need of
<span class = "pagenum">xlv</span>
<a name = "pagexlv" id = "pagexlv"> </a>
a messenger, there was sure to be a little boy at hand to run their
errand soon, faithful unto death. On receipt of painful news, they
kicked over the table, and the silver plate flew into the fire. When
roused, men murdered with a brown sword, and ladies with a penknife. We
are left uncertain whether the Cruel Mother did not also ‘howk’ a grave
for her murdered babe with that implement.</p>

<p>But readers will easily pick out and enjoy for themselves other
instances of the naïve and picturesque in these ballads.</p>

GLOSSARY OF BALLAD<br>
COMMONPLACES</a></h4>


<p>There survive in ballads a few conventional phrases, some of which
appear to have been preserved by tradition beyond an understanding of
their import. I&nbsp;give here short notes on a few of the more
interesting phrases and words which appear in the present volume, the
explanations being too cumbrous for footnotes.</p>


<h5 class = "section">Bow.</h5>

<p class = "hanging">
‘bent his bow and swam,’ <i>Lady Maisry</i>, 21.<sup>2</sup>; <i>Johney
Scot</i>, 10.<sup>2</sup>; <i>Lord Ingram and Chiel Wyet</i>,
12.<sup>2</sup>; etc.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
‘set his bent bow to his breast,’ <i>Lady Maisry</i>, 22.<sup>3</sup>;
<i>Lord Ingram and Chiel Wyet</i>, 13.<sup>3</sup>; <i>Fause
Footrage</i>, 33.<sup>1</sup>; etc.</p>

<p class = "glossary">
Child attempts no explanation of this striking phrase, which,
I&nbsp;believe, all editors have either openly or silently neglected.
Perhaps ‘bent’ may mean <i>un</i>-bent, <i>i.e.</i> with the string of
the bow slacked. If so, for what reason was it done before swimming? We
can understand that it would be of advantage to keep the string dry, but
how is it better protected when unstrung? Or, again, was it carried
unstrung,
<span class = "pagenum">xlvii</span>
<a name = "pagexlvii" id = "pagexlvii"> </a>
and literally ‘bent’ before swimming? Or was the bow solid enough to be
of support in the water?</p>

<p class = "glossary">
Some one of these explanations may satisfy the first phrase (as regards
swimming); but why does the messenger ‘set his bent bow to his breast’
before leaping the castle wall? It seems to me that the two expressions
must stand or fall together; therefore the entire lack of suggestions to
explain the latter phrase drives me to distrust of any of the
explanations given for the former.</p>

<p class = "glossary">
A suggestion recently made to me appears to dispose of all difficulties;
and, once made, is convincing in its very obviousness. It is, that ‘bow’
means ‘elbow,’ or simply ‘arm.’ The first phrase then exhibits the
commonest form of ballad-conventionalities, picturesque redundancy: the
parallel phrase is ‘he slacked his shoon and ran.’ In the second phrase
it is, indeed, necessary to suppose the wall to be breast-high; the
messenger places one elbow on the wall, pulls himself up, and vaults
across.</p>

<p class = "glossary">
Lexicographers distinguish between the Old English <i>bōg</i> or
<i>bōh</i> (O.H.G. buog = arm; Sanskrit, bahu-s = arm), which means arm,
arch, bough, or bow of a ship; and the Old English <i>boga</i> (O.H.G.
bogo), which means the archer’s bow. The distinction is continued in
Middle English, from the twelfth to the fifteenth century. Instances of
the use of the word as equivalent to ‘arm’ may be found in Old English
in <i>King Alfred’s Translation of Gregory’s Pastoral Care</i>
(E.E.T.S., 1871, ed. H.&nbsp;Sweet) written in West Saxon dialect of the
ninth century.</p>

<p class = "glossary">
It is true that the word does not survive elsewhere in this meaning, but
I give the suggestion for what it is worth.</p>


<span class = "pagenum">xlviii</span>
<a name = "pagexlviii" id = "pagexlviii"> </a>
<h5 class = "section">Briar.</h5>

<p class = "hanging">
‘briar and rose,’ <i>Douglas Tragedy</i>, 18, 19, 20; <i>Fair Margaret
and Sweet William</i>, 18, 19, 20; <i>Lord Lovel</i>, 9,&nbsp;10;
etc.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
‘briar and birk,’ <i>Lord Thomas and Fair Annet</i>, 29, 30; <i>Fair
Janet</i>, 30; etc.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
‘roses,’ <i>Lady Alice</i>, 5, 6. (See introductory note to <i>Lord
Lovel</i>, p.&nbsp;67.)</p>

<p class = "glossary">
The ballads which exhibit this pleasant conception that, after death,
the spirits of unfortunate lovers pass into plants, trees, or flowers
springing from their graves, are not confined to European folklore.
Besides appearing in English, Gaelic, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish,
German, French, Roumanian, Romaic, Portuguese, Servian, Wendish, Breton,
Italian, Albanian, Russian, etc., we find it occurring in Afghanistan
and Persia. As a rule, the branches of the trees intertwine; but in some
cases they only bend towards each other, and kiss when the wind
blows.</p>

<p class = "glossary">
In an Armenian tale a curious addition is made. A&nbsp;young man,
separated by her father from his sweetheart because he was of a
different religion, perished with her, and the two were buried by their
friends in one grave. Roses grew from the grave, and sought to
intertwine, but a <i>thorn-bush</i> sprang up between them and prevented
it. The thorn here is symbolical of religious belief.</p>


<h5 class = "section">Pin.</h5>

<p class = "hanging">
‘thrilled upon a pin,’ <i>Glasgerion</i>, 10.<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
‘knocked at the ring,’ <i>Fair Margaret and Sweet William</i>,
11.<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
(<i>Cp.</i> ‘lifted up the pin,’ <i>Fair Janet</i>,
14.<sup>2</sup>.)</p>

<span class = "pagenum">xlix</span>
<a name = "pagexlix" id = "pagexlix"> </a>

<p class = "glossary">
Throughout the Scottish ballads the expression is ‘tirl’d at the pin,’
<i>i.e.</i> rattled or twisted the pin.</p>

<p class = "glossary">
The pin appears to have been the external part of the door-latch,
attached by day thereto by means of a leathern thong, which at night was
disconnected with the latch to prevent any unbidden guest from entering.
Thus any one ‘tirling at the pin’ does not attempt to open the door, but
signifies his presence to those within.</p>

<p class = "glossary">
The ring was merely part of an ordinary knocker, and had nothing to do
with the latching of the door.</p>


<h5 class = "section">Sword.</h5>

<p class = "hanging">
‘bright brown sword,’ <i>Glasgerion</i>, 22.<sup>1</sup>; <i>Old Robin
of Portingale</i>, 22.<sup>1</sup>; <i>Child Maurice</i>,
26.<sup>1</sup>, 27.<sup>1</sup>; ‘good browne sword,’ <i>Marriage of
Sir Gawaine</i>, 24.<sup>3</sup>; etc.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
‘dried it on his sleeve,’ <i>Glasgerion</i>, 22.<sup>2</sup>; <i>Child
Maurice</i>, 27.<sup>2</sup> (‘on the grasse,’ 26.<sup>2</sup>);
‘straiked it o’er a strae,’ <i>Bonny Birdy</i>, 15.<sup>2</sup>; ‘struck
it across the plain,’ <i>Johney Scot</i>, 32.<sup>2</sup>; etc.</p>

<p class = "glossary">
In Anglo-Saxon, the epithet ‘brún’ as applied to a sword has been held
to signify either that the sword was of bronze, or that the sword
gleamed. It has further been suggested that sword-blades may have been
artificially bronzed, like modern gun-barrels.</p>

<p class = "glossary">
‘Striped it thro’ the straw’ and many similar expressions all refer to
the whetting of a sword, generally just before using it. Straw (unless
‘strae’ and ‘straw’ mean something else) would appear to be very poor
stuff on which to sharpen swords, but Glasgerion’s sleeve would be even
less effective;
<span class = "pagenum">l</span>
<a name = "pagel" id = "pagel"> </a>
perhaps, however, ‘dried’ should be ‘tried.’ Johney Scot sharpened his
sword on the ground.</p>


<h5 class = "section">Miscellaneous.</h5>

<p class = "hanging">
‘gare’ = gore, part of a woman’s dress; <i>Brown Robin</i>,
10.<sup>4</sup>; cp. <i>Glasgerion</i>, 19.<sup>4</sup>.</p>

<p class = "glossary">
Generally of a knife, apparently on a chatelaine. But in <i>Lamkin</i>
12.<sup>2</sup>, of a man’s dress.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
‘Linne,’ ‘Lin,’ <i>Young Bekie</i>, 5.<sup>4</sup>; <i>Old Robin of
Portingale</i>, 2.<sup>1</sup>.</p>

<p class = "glossary">
A stock ballad-locality, castle or town. Perhaps to be identified with
the city of Lincoln, perhaps with Lynn, or King’s Lynn, in Norfolk,
where pilgrims of the fourteenth century visited the Rood Chapel of Our
Lady of Lynn, on their way to Walsingham; with equal probability it is
not to be identified at all with any known town.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
‘shot-window,’ <i>Gay Goshawk</i>, 8.<sup>3</sup>; <i>Brown Robin</i>,
3.<sup>3</sup>; <i>Lamkin</i>, 7.<sup>3</sup>; etc.</p>

<p class = "glossary">
This commonplace phrase seems to vary in meaning. It may be ‘a shutter
of timber with a few inches of glass above it’ (Wodrow’s <i>History of
the Sufferings of the Church of Scotland</i>, Edinburgh, 1721-2,
2&nbsp;vols., in vol. ii. p.&nbsp;286); it may be simply ‘a window to
open and shut,’ as Ritson explains it; or again, as is implied in
Jamieson’s <i>Etymological Dictionary of the Scottish Language</i>, an
out-shot window, or bow-window. The last certainly seems to be intended
in certain instances.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">li</span>
<a name = "pageli" id = "pageli"> </a>
<p class = "hanging">
‘thought lang’ <i>Young Bekie</i>, 16.<sup>4</sup>; <i>Brown Adam</i>,
5.<sup>2</sup>; <i>Johney Scot</i>, 6.<sup>2</sup>; <i>Fause
Footrage</i>, 25.<sup>2</sup>; etc.</p>

<p class = "glossary">
This simply means ‘thought it long,’ or ‘thought it slow,’ as we should
say in modern slang; in short, ‘was bored,’ or ‘weary.’</p>

<p class = "hanging">
‘wild-wood swine,’ a simile for drunkenness, <i>Brown Robin</i>,
7.<sup>4</sup>; <i>Fause Footrage</i>, 16.<sup>4</sup>.</p>

<p class = "glossary">
<i>Cp.</i> Shakespeare, <i>All’s Well that Ends Well</i>, Act <span
class = "smallroman">IV.</span> 3, 286: ‘Drunkenness is his best virtue;
for he will be swine-drunk.’ It seems to be nothing more than a popular
comparison.</p>

Royal <span class = "smallroman">MS.</span> 10. <span class =

Museum, where they occur on folios 34 <i>verso</i>, 215 <i>recto</i>,

decorated margin at the foot of each page, and are outlined in ink and
roughly tinted in three or four colours. Much use is made of them in the
illustrations to J.&nbsp;J. Jusserand’s <i>English Wayfaring Life in the

For the subject of the origin of the ballad and its refrain in the

Poetry</i>, by Professor Francis B. Gummere, especially chap.&nbsp;v.
The beginning of the whole subject is to be found in the universal and
innate practices of accompanying manual or bodily labour by a rhythmic
chant or song, and of festal song and dance.</p>

‘He [Coleridge] said the <i>Lyrical Ballads</i> were an experiment about

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span>, from the Percy Folio,
luckily is complete, saving an omission of two lines. A&nbsp;few obvious
corrections have been introduced, and the Folio reading given in a
footnote. Percy printed the ballad in the <i>Reliques</i>, with far
fewer alterations than usual.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Story</span> is also told in a
milk-and-water Scotch version, <i>Glenkindie</i>, doubtless mishandled
by Jamieson, who ‘improved’ it from two traditional sources. The
admirable English ballad gives a striking picture of the horror of
‘churlës blood’ proper to feudal days.</p>

<p>In the quotation above, Chaucer places Glascurion with Orpheus,
Arion, and Chiron, four great harpers. It is not improbable that
Glascurion and Glasgerion represent the Welsh bard Glas Keraint (Keraint
the Blue Bard, the chief bard wearing a blue robe of office), said to
have been an eminent poet, the son of Owain, Prince of Glamorgan.</p>

<p>The oath taken ‘by oak and ash and thorn’ (stanza&nbsp;18) is a relic
of very early times. An oath ‘by corn’ is in <i>Young Hunting</i>.</p>

<h4 class = "chapter">YOUNG BEKIE</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> is that of the
Jamieson-Brown <span class = "smallroman">MS.</span>, taken down from
the recitation of Mrs. Brown about 1783. In printing the ballad,
Jamieson collated with the above two other Scottish copies, one in <span
class = "smallroman">MS.</span>, another a stall-copy, a&nbsp;third from
recitation in the north of England, a&nbsp;fourth ‘picked off an old
wall in Piccadilly’ by the editor.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Story</span> has several variations of
detail in the numerous versions known (Young Bicham, Brechin, Bekie,
Beachen, Beichan, Bichen, Lord Beichan, Lord Bateman, Young Bondwell,
etc.), but the text here given is one of the most complete and vivid,
and contains besides one feature (the ‘Belly Blin’) lost in all other
versions but one.</p>

<p>A similar story is current in the ballad-literature of Scandinavia,
Spain, and Italy; but the English tale has undoubtedly been affected by
the charming legend of Gilbert Becket, the father of Saint Thomas, who,
having been captured by Admiraud, a&nbsp;Saracen prince, and held in
durance vile, was freed by Admiraud’s daughter, who then followed him to
England, knowing no English but ‘London’ and ‘Gilbert’; and after much
tribulation, found him and was married to him. ‘Becket’ is sufficiently
near ‘Bekie’ to prove contamination, but not to prove that the legend is
the origin of the ballad.</p>

<p>The Belly Blin (Billie Blin = billie, a&nbsp;man; blin’, blind, and
so Billie Blin = Blindman’s Buff, formerly
<span class = "pagenum">7</span>
<a name = "page7" id = "page7"> </a>
called Hoodman Blind) occurs in certain other ballads, such as
<i>Cospatrick</i>, <i>Willie’s Lady</i>, and the <i>Knight and the
Shepherd’s Daughter</i>; also in a mutilated ballad of the Percy Folio,
<i>King Arthur and King Cornwall</i>, under the name Burlow Beanie. In
the latter case he is described as ‘a lodly feend, with seuen heads, and
one body,’ breathing fire; but in general he is a serviceable household
demon. Cp. German <i>bilwiz</i>, and Dutch <i>belewitte</i>.</p>

<i>literatim</i>, in preference to the copy served up ‘with considerable

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Story</span> is practically identical
with that of <i>Little Musgrave and Lady Barnard</i>; but each is so
good, though in a different vein, that neither could be excluded.</p>

<p>The last stanza narrates the practice of burning a cross on the flesh
of the right shoulder when setting forth to the Holy
Land&mdash;a&nbsp;practice which obtained only among the very devout or
superstitious of the Crusaders. Usually a cross of red cloth attached to
the right shoulder of the coat was deemed sufficient.</p>

<h4 class = "chapter">LITTLE MUSGRAVE AND LADY BARNARD</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> here given is the version
printed, with very few variations, in <i>Wit Restor’d</i>, 1658, <i>Wit
and Drollery</i>, 1682, Dryden’s <i>Miscellany</i>, 1716, etc. The Percy
Folio contains a fragmentary version, consisting of some dozen stanzas.
Child says that all the Scottish versions are late, and probably
derived, though taken down from oral tradition, from printed copies. As
recompense, we have the Scotch <i>Bonny Birdy</i>.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Story</span> would seem to be purely
English. That it was popular long before the earliest known text is
proved by quotations from it in old plays: as from <i>Fair Margaret and
Sweet William</i>. Merrythought in <i>The Knight of the Burning
Pestle</i> (1611) sings from this ballad a version of stanza 14, and
Beaumont and Fletcher also put quotations into the mouths of characters
in <i>Bonduca</i> (circ. 1619) and <i>Monsieur Thomas</i> (circ. 1639).
Other plays before 1650 also mention&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>The reader should remember, once for all, that burdens are to be

<h4 class = "chapter">FAIR ANNIE</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> is that of Scott’s
<i>Minstrelsy</i>, ‘chiefly from the recitation of an old woman.’ Scott
names the ballad ‘Lord Thomas and Fair Annie,’ adding to the confusion
already existing with ‘Lord Thomas and Fair Annet.’</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Story.</span>&mdash;Fair Annie, stolen
from the home of her father, the Earl of Wemyss, by ‘a knight out o’er
the sea,’ has borne seven sons to him. He now bids her prepare to
welcome home his real bride, and she meekly obeys, suppressing her tears
with difficulty. Lord Thomas and his new-come bride hear, through the
wall of their bridal chamber, Annie bewailing her lot, and wishing her
seven sons had never been born. The bride goes to comfort her, discovers
in her a long-lost sister, and departs, thanking heaven she goes a
maiden home.</p>

<p>Of this ballad, Herd printed a fragment in 1769, some stanzas being
incorporated in the present version. Similar tales abound in the
folklore of Scandinavia, Holland, and Germany. But, three hundred years
older than any version of the ballad, is the lay of Marie de France,
<i>Le Lai de Freisne</i>; which, nevertheless, is only another offshoot
of some undiscovered common origin.</p>

<p>It is imperative (in&nbsp;4.<sup>4</sup>) that Annie should
<i>braid</i> her hair, as a sign of virginity: married women only bound
up their hair, or wore it under a cap.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Story</span>, if we omit the hard tests

<p>The disagreeable nature of the final insult (stt. 27-29), retained
here only for the sake of fidelity to the original text, may be
paralleled by the similarly sudden lapse of taste in the <i>Nut-Brown

<h4 class = "chapter smallcaps">EARL BRAND, THE DOUGLAS TRAGEDY, and THE
CHILD OF ELL</h4>


<p><span class = "firstword">There</span> are here put in juxtaposition
three versions in ballad-form of the same story, though fragmentary in
the two latter cases, not only because each is good, but to show the
possibilities of variation in a popular story. There is yet another
ballad, <i>Erlinton</i>, printed by Sir Walter Scott in the
<i>Minstrelsy</i>, embodying an almost identical tale. <i>Earl Brand</i>
preserves most of the features of a very ancient story with more
exactitude than any other traditional ballad. But in this case, as in
too many others, we must turn to a Scandinavian ballad for the complete
form of the story. A&nbsp;Danish ballad, <i>Ribold and Guldborg</i>,
gives the fine tale thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>Ribold, a king’s son, in love with Guldborg, offers to carry her away
‘to a land where death and sorrow come not, where all the birds are
cuckoos, where all the grass is leeks, where all the streams run with
wine.’ Guldborg is willing, but doubts whether she can escape the strict
watch kept over her by her family and by her betrothed lover. Ribold
disguises her in his armour and a cloak, and they ride away. On the moor
they meet an earl, who asks, ‘Whither away?’ Ribold answers that he is
taking his youngest sister from a cloister. This does not deceive the
earl, nor does a bribe close his mouth; and Guldborg’s father, learning
that she is away with Ribold, rides with his sons in pursuit. Ribold
bids Guldborg hold his horse, and prepares to fight; he tells her that,
whatever may
<span class = "pagenum">45</span>
<a name = "page45" id = "page45"> </a>
chance, she must not call on him by name. Ribold slays her father and
some of her kin and six of her brothers; only her youngest brother is
left: Guldborg cries, ‘Ribold, spare him,’ that he may carry tidings to
her mother. Immediately Ribold receives a mortal wound. He ceases
fighting, sheathes his sword, and says to her, ‘Wilt thou go home to thy
mother again, or wilt thou follow so sad a swain?’ And she says she will
follow him. In silence they ride on. ‘Why art not thou merry as before?’
asks Guldborg. And Ribold answers, ‘Thy brother’s sword has been in my
heart.’ They reach his house: he calls for one to take his horse,
another to fetch a priest; for his brother shall have Guldborg. But she
refuses. That night dies Ribold, and Guldborg slays herself and dies in
his arms.</p>

<p>A second and even more dramatic ballad, <i>Hildebrand and Hilde</i>,
tells a similar story.</p>

<p>A comparison of the above tale with <i>Earl Brand</i> will show a
close agreement in most of the incidents. The chief loss in the English
ballad is the request of Ribold, that Guldborg must not speak his name
while he fights. The very name ‘Brand’ is doubtless a direct derivative
of ‘Hildebrand.’ Winchester (13.<sup>2</sup>), as it implies a nunnery,
corresponds to the cloister in the Danish ballad. Earl Brand directs his
mother to marry the King’s daughter to his youngest brother; but her
refusal, if she did as Guldborg did, has been lost.</p>

<p><i>The Douglas Tragedy</i>, a beautiful but fragmentary version, is,
says Scott, ‘one of the few to which popular tradition has ascribed
complete locality.’ The ascribed locality, if more complete, is no more
probable than any other: to ascribe any definite locality to a ballad is
in all cases a waste of time and labour.</p>

<i>The Child of Ell</i>, in the Percy Folio, <i>may</i> have contained
anything; but immediately we approach a point where comparison would be
of interest, we meet an <i>hiatus valde deflendus</i>. Percy, in the
<i>Reliques</i>, expanded the fragment here given to about five times
the length.</p>

<h4 class = "chapter">LORD THOMAS AND FAIR ANNET</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> is from Percy’s
<i>Reliques</i> (vol. ii., 1765: vol. iii., 1767). In the latter edition
he also gives the English version of the ballad earlier in the same
volume.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Story.</span>&mdash;This ballad, as it
is one of the most beautiful, is also one of the most popular. It should
be compared with <i>Fair Margaret and Sweet William</i>, in which the
forlorn maid dies of grief, not by the hand of her rival.</p>

<p>A series of Norse ballads tell much the same tale, but in none is the
‘friends’ will’ a crucial point. Chansons from Burgundy, Bretagne,
Provence, and northern Italy, faintly echo the story.</p>

<p>Lord Thomas his mither says that Fair Annet has no ‘gowd and gear’;
yet later on we find that Annet’s father can provide her with a horse
shod with silver and gold, and four-and-twenty silver bells in his mane;
she is attended by a large company, her cleading skinkles, and her belt
is of pearl.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Story</span> is much the same as

<p>None of the known copies of the ballad are as early in date as <i>The

first produced, it is said, in 1611), in which the humorous old

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text.</span>&mdash;This ballad,
concluding a small class of three&mdash;<i>Lord Thomas and Fair
Annet</i>, and <i>Fair Margaret and Sweet William</i> being the other
two&mdash;is distinguished by the fact that the lady dies of hope
deferred. It is a foolish ballad, at the opposite pole to <i>Lord Thomas
and Fair Annet</i>, and is pre-eminently one of the class meant only to
be sung, with an effective burden. The text given here, therefore, is
that of a broadside of the year 1846.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Story</span> in outline is extremely
popular in German and Scandinavian literature. Of the former the
commonest is <i>Der Ritter und die <ins class= "correction" title=
"spelling unchanged">Maid</ins></i>, also found north of Germany;
twenty-six different versions in all, in some of which lilies spring
from the grave. In a Swedish ballad a linden-tree grows out of their
bodies; in Danish ballads, roses, lilies, or lindens. This conclusion,
a&nbsp;commonplace in folk-song, occurs also in a class of Romaic
ballads, where a clump of reeds rises from one of the lovers, and a
cypress or lemon-tree from the other, which bend to each other and
mingle their leaves whenever the wind blows. Classical readers will
recall the tale of Philemon and Baucis.</p>

refusing the young lords of the north country, and saying that her love

for ‘drawing up with an English lord,’ and commands her to renounce him.
She refuses, and is condemned to be burned. A&nbsp;bonny boy bears news
of her plight to Lord William, who leaps to boot and saddle; but he
arrives too late to save her, though he vows vengeance on all her kin,
and promises to burn himself last of all.</p>

<h4 class = "chapter">THE CRUEL BROTHER</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> is that obtained in 1800 by
Alexander Fraser Tytler from Mrs. Brown of Falkland, and by him
committed to writing. The first ten and the last two stanzas show
corruption, but the rest of the ballad is in the best style.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Story</span> emphasises the necessity
of asking the consent of a brother to the marriage of his sister, and
therefore the title <i>The Cruel Brother</i> is a misnomer. In
ballad-times, the brother would have been well within his rights; it was
rather a fatal oversight of the bridegroom that caused the tragedy.</p>

<p>Danish and German ballads echo the story, though in the commonest
German ballad, <i>Graf Friedrich</i>, the bride receives an
<i>accidental</i> wound, and that from the bridegroom’s own hand.</p>

<p>The testament of the bride, by which she benefits her friends and
leaves curses on her enemies, is very characteristic of the
ballad-style, and is found in other ballads, as <i>Lord Ronald</i> and
<i>Edward, Edward</i>. In the present case, ‘sister Grace’ obtains what
would seem to be a very doubtful benefit.</p>

<h4 class = "chapter">THE NUTBROWN MAID</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> is from Arnold’s
<i>Chronicle</i>, of the edition which, from typographical evidence, is
said to have been printed at Antwerp in 1502 by John Doesborowe. Each
stanza is there printed in six long lines. Considerable variations
appear in later editions. There is also a Balliol <span class =
"smallroman">MS.</span> (354), which contains a contemporary version,
and the Percy Folio contains a corrupt version.</p>

<p>This should not be considered as a ballad proper; it is rather a
‘dramatic lyric.’ Its history, however, is quite as curious as that of
many ballads. It occurs, as stated above, in the farrago known as the
<i>Chronicle</i> of Richard Arnold, inserted between a list of the
‘tolls’ due on merchandise entering or leaving the port of Antwerp, and
a table giving Flemish weights and moneys in terms of the corresponding
English measures. Why such a poem should be printed in such incongruous
surroundings, what its date or who its author was, are questions
impossible to determine. Its position here is perhaps almost as
incongruous as in its original place.</p>

<p>From 3.<sup>9</sup> to the end of the last verse but one, it is a
dialogue between an earl’s son and a baron’s daughter, in alternate
stanzas; a&nbsp;prologue and an epilogue are added by the author.</p>

<p>Matthew Prior printed the poem in his works, in order to contrast it
with his own version, <i>Henry and Emma</i>, which appealed to
contemporary taste as more elegant than its rude original.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text.</span>&mdash;Of seven or eight
variants of this ballad, only three preserve the full form of the story.
On the whole, the one here given&mdash;from Sharp’s <i>Ballad Book</i>,
as sung by an old woman in Perthshire&mdash;is the best, as the other
two&mdash;from Herd’s <i>Scots Songs</i>, and the Kinloch <span class =
"smallroman">MSS.</span>&mdash;are slightly contaminated by extraneous
matter.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Story</span> is a simple ballad-tale of
‘true-love twinned’; but the episode of the dancing forms a link with a
number of German and Scandinavian ballads, in which compulsory dancing
and horse-riding is made a test of the guilt of an accused maiden. In
the Scotch ballad the horse-riding has shrunk almost to nothing, and the
dancing is not compulsory. The resemblance is faint, and the barbarities
of the Continental versions are happily wanting in our ballad.</p>

<h4 class = "chapter">BROWN ADAM</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> is given from the
Jamieson-Brown <span class = "smallroman">MS.</span> It was first
printed by Scott, with the omission of the second stanza&mdash;perhaps
justifiable&mdash;and a few minor changes. He notes that he had seen a
copy printed on a single sheet.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Story</span> has a remote parallel in a
Danish ballad, extant in manuscripts of the sixteenth century and later,
<i>Den afhugne Haand</i>. The tale is told as follows. Lutzelil, knowing
the evil ways of Lawi Pederson, rejects his proffered love. Lawi vows
she shall repent it, and the maiden is afraid for nine months to go to
church, but goes at Easter. Lawi meets her in a wood, and repeats his
offer. She begs him to do her no harm, feigns compliance, and makes an
assignation in the chamber of her maids. She returns home and tells her
father, who watches for Lawi. When he comes and demands admission, she
denies the assignation. Lawi breaks down the door, and discovers
Lutzelil’s father with a drawn sword, with which he cuts off Lawi’s
hand.</p>

<p>The reason for objecting to the second stanza as here given is not so
much the inadequacy of a golden hammer, or the unusual whiteness of the
smith’s fingers, but the rhyme in the third line.</p>

<h4 class = "chapter">THE MARRIAGE OF SIR GAWAINE</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> is from the early part of
the Percy Folio, and the ballad is therefore deficient. Where gaps are
marked in the text with a row of asterisks, about nine stanzas are lost
in each case&mdash;half a page torn out by a seventeenth-century
maidservant to light a fire! Luckily we can supply the story from other
versions.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Story</span>, also given in <i>The
Weddynge of S<sup>r</sup> Gawen and Dame Ragnell</i> (in the Rawlinson
<span class = "smallroman">MS. C.</span> 86 in the Bodleian Library),
runs as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Shortly after Christmas, Arthur, riding by Tarn Wadling (still so
called, but now pasture-land, in the forest of Inglewood), meets a bold
baron, who challenges him to fight, unless he can win his ransom by
returning on New Year’s Day with an answer to the question, What does a
woman most desire? Arthur relates the story to Gawaine, asks him and
others for an answer to the riddle, and collects their suggestions in a
book (‘letters,’ 24.<sup>1</sup>). On his way to keep his tryst with the
baron, he meets an unspeakably ugly woman, who offers her assistance; if
she will help him, Arthur says, she shall wed with Gawaine. She gives
him the true answer, A&nbsp;woman will have her will. Arthur meets the
baron, and after proffering the budget of answers, confronts him with
the true answer. The baron exclaims against the ugly woman, whom he
asserts to be his sister.</p>

<p>Arthur returns to his court, and tells his knights that a wife awaits
one of them on the moor. Sir
<span class = "pagenum">108</span>
<a name = "page108" id = "page108"> </a>
Lancelot, Sir Steven (who is not mentioned elsewhere in Arthurian
tales), Sir Kay, Sir Bauier (probably Beduer or Bedivere), Sir Bore
(Bors de Gauves), Sir Garrett (Gareth), and Sir Tristram ride forth to
find her. At sight, Sir Kay, without overmuch chivalry, expresses his
disgust, and the rest are unwilling to marry her. The king explains that
he has promised to give her to Sir Gawaine, who, it seems, bows to
Arthur’s authority, and weds her. During the bridal night, she becomes a
beautiful young woman. Further to test Gawaine, she gives him his
choice: will he have her fair by day and foul by night, or foul by day
and fair by night? Fair by night, says Gawaine. And foul to be seen of
all by day? she asks. Have your way, says Gawaine, and breaks the last
thread of the spell, as she forthwith explains: her step-mother had
bewitched both her, to haunt the moor in ugly shape, till some knight
should grant her <i>all</i> her will, and her brother, to challenge all
comers to fight him or answer the riddle.</p>

<p>Similar tales, but with the important variation&mdash;undoubtedly
indigenous in the story&mdash;that the man who saves his life by
answering the riddle has himself to wed the ugly woman, are told by
Gower (<i>Confessio Amantis</i>, Book <span class =
"smallroman">I</span>.) and Chaucer (<i>The Tale of the Wyf of
Bathe</i>). The latter, which is also Arthurian in its setting, was made
into a ballad in the <i>Crown Garland of Golden Roses</i> (<i>circ.</i>
1600), compiled by Richard Johnson. A&nbsp;parallel is also to be found
in an Icelandic saga.</p>

<h4 class = "chapter">THE BOY AND THE MANTLE</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">Text.</span>&mdash;The Percy Folio is the
sole authority for this excellent lively ballad. It is here given as it
stands in the manuscript, except for division into stanzas. Percy
printed the ballad ‘<i>verbatim</i>,’&mdash;that is, with
emendations&mdash;and also a revised version.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Story</span>, which exists in countless
variations in many lands, is told from the earliest times in connection
with the Arthurian legend-cycle. Restricting the article used as a
criterion of chastity to a mantle, we find the elements of this ballad
existing in French manuscripts of the thirteenth century (the romance
called <i>Cort Mantel</i>); in a Norse translation of this ‘fabliau’; in
the Icelandic <i>Mantle Rhymes</i> of the fifteenth century; in the
<i>Scalachronica</i> of Sir Thomas Gray of Heton (<i>circ.</i> 1355); in
Germany, and in Gaelic (a&nbsp;ballad known in Irish writings, but not
in Scottish); as well as in many other versions.</p>

<p>The trial by the drinking-horn is a fable equally old, as far as the
evidence goes, and equally widespread; but it is not told elsewhere in
connection with the parallel story of the mantle. Other tests used for
the purpose of discovering infidelity or unchastity are:&mdash; a crown,
a magic bridge (German); a&nbsp;girdle (English; cp. Florimel’s girdle
in the <i>Faery Queen</i>, Book iv. Canto&nbsp;5); a bed,
a&nbsp;stepping-stone by the bedside, a&nbsp;chair (Scandinavian);
flowers (Sanskrit); a&nbsp;shirt (German and Flemish); a&nbsp;picture
(Italian, translated to England&mdash;cp. Massinger’s <i>The Picture</i>
(1630), where he localises
<span class = "pagenum">120</span>
<a name = "page120" id = "page120"> </a>
the story in Hungary); a&nbsp;ring (French); a mirror (German, French,
and Italian); and so forth.</p>

<p>Caxton, in his preface to <i>Kyng Arthur</i> (1485), says:&mdash;
‘Item, in the castel of Douer ye may see Gauwayn’s skull and Cradok’s
mantel.’ Sir Thomas Gray says the mantle was made into a chasuble, and
was preserved at Glastonbury.</p>

<p>Thomas Love Peacock says (<i>The Misfortunes of Elphin</i>, chap.
xii.), ‘Tegau Eurvron, or Tegau of the Golden Bosom, was the wife of
Caradoc [Craddocke], and one of the Three Chaste Wives of the island of
Britain.’ A similar statement is recorded by Percy at the end of his
‘revised and altered’ ballad, taking it from ‘the Rev. Evan Evans,
editor of the Specimens of Welsh Poetry.’</p>

<h4 class = "chapter">JOHNEY SCOT</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> of this popular and
excellent ballad is given from the Jamieson-Brown <span class =
"smallroman">MS.</span> It was copied, with wilful alterations, into
Scott’s Abbotsford <span class = "smallroman">MS.</span> called
<i>Scottish Songs</i>. Professor Child prints sixteen variants of the
ballad, nearly all from manuscripts.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Story</span> of the duel with the
Italian is given with more detail in other versions. In two ballads from
Motherwell’s <span class = "smallroman">MS.</span>, where ‘the Italian’
becomes ‘the Tailliant’ or ‘the Talliant,’ the champion jumps over
Johney’s head, and descends on the point of Johney’s sword. This exploit
is paralleled in a Breton ballad, where the Seigneur Les Aubrays of St.
Brieux is ordered by the French king to combat his wild Moor, who leaps
in the air and is received on the sword of his antagonist. Again, in
Scottish tradition, James Macgill, having killed Sir Robert Balfour
about 1679, went to London to procure his pardon, which Charles <span
class = "smallroman">II.</span> offered him on the condition of fighting
an Italian gladiator. The Italian leaped once over James Macgill, but in
attempting to repeat this manœuvre was spitted by his opponent, who
thereby procured not only his pardon, but also knighthood.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Texts.</span>&mdash;The version here given
is compounded from two different sources, almost of necessity. Stanzas
1-19 were given by Scott, compounded from W.&nbsp;Tytler’s Brown <span

at stanza 20 Scott’s version becomes eccentric, and he prints such
verses as:&mdash;</p>

Norwegian, four Färöe, and eight or nine Swedish.</p>

<h4 class = "chapter">YOUNG WATERS</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> is that of a copy mentioned
by Percy, ‘printed not long since at Glasgow, in one sheet 8vo. The
world was indebted for its publication to the lady Jean Hume, sister to
the Earle of Hume, who died lately at Gibraltar.’ The original edition,
discovered by Mr. Macmath after Professor Child’s version (from the
<i>Reliques</i>) was in print, is:&mdash; ‘Young Waters, an Ancient
Scottish Poem, never before printed. Glasgow, printed and sold by Robert
and Andrew Foulis, 1755.’ This was also known to Maidment. Hardly a word
differs from Percy’s version; but here I have substituted the spellings
‘wh’ for Percy’s ‘quh,’ in ‘quhen,’ etc., and ‘y’ for his ‘z’ in ‘zoung,
zou,’ etc.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Story</span> has had historical
foundations suggested for it by Percy and Chambers. Percy identified
Young Waters with the Earl of Murray, murdered, according to the
chronicle of Sir James Balfour, on the 7th of February 1592. Chambers,
in 1829, relying on Buchan’s version of the ballad, had no doubt that
Young Waters was one of the Scots nobles executed by James <span class =
"smallroman">I.</span>, and was very probably Walter Stuart, second son
of the Duke of Albany. Thirty years later, Chambers was equally certain
that the ballad was the composition of Lady Wardlaw.</p>

<p>In a Scandinavian ballad, Folke Lovmandson is a favourite at court;
a&nbsp;little wee page makes the fatal remark and excites the king’s
jealousy. The innocent knight is rolled down a hill in a barrel set with
knives&mdash;a&nbsp;punishment common in Scandinavian folklore.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Story</span> of Barbara Allan’s scorn

records of Mrs. Knipp, ‘In perfect pleasure I was to hear her sing, and

Goldsmith’s words are equally well known: ‘The music of the finest
singer is dissonance to what I felt when an old dairymaid sung me into
tears with <i>Johnny Armstrong’s Last Goodnight</i>, or <i>The Cruelty
of Barbara Allen</i>.’ The tune is excessively popular: it is given in

<span class = "smallroman">MS.</span>, on which version Scott drew
partly for his ballad in the <i>Minstrelsy</i>. Mrs. Brown recited the

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Story.</span>&mdash;One point, the

feature in many European ballads.</p>

<p>It is perhaps needless to remark that no goshawk sings sweetly, much
less talks. In Buchan’s version (of forty-nine stanzas) the goshawk is
exchanged for a parrot.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Story</span> is a genuine bit of

king remarks that ‘this is a sturdy dame.’ The king’s daughter, one
would think, who conceals Robin’s bow in her bosom, must also have been
somewhat sturdy. Note the picturesque touch in&nbsp;8.<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<h4 class = "chapter">CHILD MAURICE</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> is from the Percy Folio,
given <i>literatim</i>, with two rearrangements of the lines (in stt. 4
and&nbsp;22) and a few obvious corrections, as suggested by Hales, and
Furnivall, and Child. The Folio version was printed by Jamieson in his
<i>Popular Ballads and Songs</i>.</p>

<p>The Scotch version, <i>Gil Morrice</i>, was printed by Percy in the
<i>Reliques</i> in preference to the version of his Folio. He notes that
the ballad ‘has lately run through two editions in Scotland: the second
was printed at Glasgow in 1755.’ Thanks to an advertisement prefixed to
these Scottish editions, sixteen additional verses were obtained and
added by Percy, who thought that they were ‘perhaps after all only an
ingenious interpolation.’ <i>Gil Morrice</i> introduces ‘Lord Barnard’
in place of ‘John Steward,’ adopted, perhaps, from <i>Little Musgrave
and Lady Barnard</i>. Motherwell’s versions were variously called
<i>Child Noryce</i>, <i>Bob Norice</i>, <i>Gill Morice</i>, <i>Chield
Morice</i>. Certainly the Folio ballad is unsurpassed for its vigorous,
objective style, and forcible, vivid pictures.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Story</span> of this ballad gave rise
to Home’s <i>Douglas</i>, a&nbsp;tragedy, produced in the Concert Hall,
Canongate, Edinburgh, 1756 (on which occasion the heroine’s name was
given as ‘Lady Barnard’), and transferred to Covent Garden Theatre, in
London, in 1757, the heroine’s name being altered to ‘Lady
Randolph.’</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">166</span>
<a name = "page166" id = "page166"> </a>
<p>Perhaps in the same year in which the play was produced in London,
the poet Gray wrote from Cambridge:&mdash; ‘I&nbsp;have got the old
Scotch ballad on which <i>Douglas</i> was founded; it is divine, and as
long as from hence to Aston. Aristotle’s best rules are observed in it
in a manner which shows the author never had heard of Aristotle. It
begins in the fifth act of the play. You may read it two-thirds through
without guessing what it is about; and yet, when you come to the end, it
is impossible not to understand the whole story.’</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> is from Alexander Fraser
Tytler’s Brown <span class = "smallroman">MS.</span>, which was also the
source of Scott’s version in the <i>Minstrelsy</i>. One line
(31.<sup>1</sup>), closely resembling a line in Lady Wardlaw’s forged
ballad <i>Hardyknute</i>, caused Sir Walter to investigate strictly the
authenticity of the ballad, but the evidence of Lady Douglas, that she
had learned the ballad in her childhood, and could still repeat much of
it, removed his doubts. It is, however, quite possible, as Professor
Child points out, ‘that Mrs. Brown may unconsciously have adopted this
verse from the tiresome and affected <i>Hardyknute</i>, so much esteemed
in her day.’</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Story.</span>&mdash;In <i>The Complaynt
of Scotlande</i> (1549) there is mentioned a tale ‘how the King of
Estmure Land married the King’s daughter of Westmure Land,’ and it has
been suggested that there is a connection with the ballad.</p>

<p>This is another of the ballads of which the English form has become
so far corrupted that we have to seek its Scandinavian counterpart to
obtain the full form of the story. The ballad is especially popular in
Denmark, where it is found in twenty-three manuscripts, as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The rich Svend wooes Lisbet, who favours William for his good
qualities. Svend, ill with grief, is well-advised by his mother, not to
care for a plighted maid, and ill-advised by his sister, to kill
William. Svend
<span class = "pagenum">173</span>
<a name = "page173" id = "page173"> </a>
takes the latter advice, and kills William. Forty weeks later, Lisbet
gives birth to a son, but Svend is told that the child is a girl.
Eighteen years later, the young William, sporting with a peasant,
quarrels with him; the peasant retorts, ‘You had better avenge your
father’s death.’ Young William asks his mother who slew his father, and
she, thinking him too young to fight, counsels him to bring Svend to a
court. William charges him in the court with the murder of his father,
and says that no compensation has been offered. Not a penny shall be
paid, says Svend. William draws his sword, and slays him.</p>

<p>Icelandic, Swedish, and Färöe ballads tell a similar story.</p>

down from the recitation of Mrs. Brown in 1800, who had previously

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Story.</span>&mdash;A mother, who
feigns to be her own son and demands tokens of the girl outside the
gate, turns her son’s love away, and is cursed by him. Similar ballads
exist in France, Germany, and Greece.</p>

<p>There is an early eighteenth-century <span class =
"smallroman">MS.</span> (Elizabeth Cochrane’s <i>Song-Book</i>) of this
ballad, which gives a preliminary history. Isabel of Rochroyal dreams of
her love Gregory; she rises up, calls for a swift steed, and rides forth
till she meets a company. They ask her who she is, and are told that she
is ‘Fair Isabel of Rochroyal,’ seeking her true-love Gregory. They
direct her to ‘yon castle’; and thenceforth the tale proceeds much as in
the other versions.</p>

<h4 class = "chapter">HIND HORN</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> is from Motherwell’s <span
class = "smallroman">MS.</span>, written from the recitation of a Mrs.
King of Kilbarchan.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Story</span> of the ballad is a mere
remnant of the story told in the Gest of King Horn, preserved in three
manuscripts, the oldest of which belongs to the thirteenth century.
Similar stories are given in a French romance of the fourteenth century,
and an English manuscript of the same date. The complete story in the
Gest may be condensed as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Horn, son of Murry, King of Suddenne, was captured by Saracens, who
killed his father, and turned him and his twelve companions adrift in a
boat, which was eventually beached safely on the coast of Westerness,
and Ailmar the king took them in and brought them up. Rymenhild his
daughter, falling in love with Horn, offered herself to him. He refused,
unless she would make the king knight him. She did so, and again claimed
his love; but he said he must first prove his knighthood. She gave him a
ring set with stones, such that he could never be slain if he looked on
it and thought of her. His first feat was the slaying of a hundred
heathens; then he returned to Rymenhild. Meanwhile, however, one of his
companions had told the king that Horn meant to kill him and wed his
daughter. Ailmar ordered Horn to quit his court; and Horn, having told
Rymenhild that if he did not come back in seven years she might marry
another, sailed to the court of King Thurston in Ireland, where he
stayed for seven years, performing feats of valour with the aid of
Rymenhild’s ring.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">186</span>
<a name = "page186" id = "page186"> </a>
At the end of the allotted time, Rymenhild was to be married to King
Modi of Reynis. Horn, hearing of this, went back to Westerness, arrived
on the marriage-morn, met a palmer (the old beggar man of the ballad),
changed clothes with him, and entered the hall. According to custom,
Rymenhild served wine to the guests, and as Horn drank, he dropped her
ring into the vessel. When she discovered it, she sent for the palmer,
and questioned him. He said Horn had died on the voyage thither.
Rymenhild seized a knife she had hidden to kill King Modi and herself if
Horn came not, and set it to her breast. The palmer threw off his
disguise, saying, ‘I am Horn.’ Still he would not wed her till he had
regained his father’s kingdom of Suddenne, and went away and did so.
Meanwhile a false friend seized Rymenhild; but on the marriage-day Horn
returned, killed him, and finally made Rymenhild his wife and Queen of
Suddenne.</p>

<h4 class = "chapter">EDWARD</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> is that given by Percy in
the <i>Reliques</i> (1765), with the substitution of <i>w</i> for
initial <i>qu</i>, and <i>y</i> for initial <i>z</i>, as in <i>Young
Waters</i> (see p. 146). In the fourth edition of the <i>Reliques</i>
Percy states that ‘this curious song was transmitted to the editor by
Sir David Dalrymple, Bart., late Lord Hailes.’</p>

<p>Percy’s adoption of antique spelling in this ballad has caused some
doubt to be thrown on its authenticity; but there is also a version
<i>Son Davie</i>, given in his <i>Minstrelsy</i> by Motherwell, who, in
referring to the version in the <i>Reliques</i>, said there was reason
for believing that Lord Hailes ‘made a few slight verbal improvements in
the copy he transmitted, and altered the hero’s name to Edward,
a&nbsp;name which, by the bye, never occurs in a Scottish ballad except
where allusion is made to an English king.’</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Story</span> has a close parallel in
Swedish, the form of the ballad remaining in dialogue.</p>

<p>Motherwell points out that the verses of which <i>Edward</i> consists
generally form the conclusion of the ballad of <i>The Twa Brothers</i>,
and also of certain versions of <i>Lizie Wan</i>; and is inclined to
regard <i>Edward</i> as detached from one of those ballads. More
probably the reverse is the case, that the story of <i>Edward</i> has
been attached to the other ballads.</p>

<p>The present version of the ballad exhibits an unusual amplification
of the refrain. The story is told in two lines of each eight-lined
stanza; but the lyrical effect added by the elaborate refrain is almost
unique.</p>

<h4 class = "chapter">LORD RANDAL</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> is from Scott’s
<i>Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</i> (1803). Other forms give the
name as <i>Lord Ronald</i>, but Scott retains <i>Randal</i> on the
supposition that the ballad originated in the death of ‘Thomas Randolph,
or Randal, Earl of Murray, nephew to Robert Bruce, and governor of
Scotland,’ who died at Musselburgh in 1332.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Story</span> of the ballad is found in
Italian tradition nearly three hundred years ago, and also occurs in
Dutch, German, Swedish, Danish, Magyar, Wendish, etc.</p>

<p>Certain variants of the ballad bear the title of <i>The Croodlin
Doo</i>, and the ‘handsome young man’ is changed for a child, and the
poisoner is the child’s step-mother. Scott suggests that this change was
made ‘to excite greater interest in the nursery.’ In nearly all forms of
the ballad, the poisoning is done by the substitution of snakes (‘eels’)
for fish, a common method amongst the ancients of administering
poison.</p>

<p>Child gives a collation of seven versions secured in America of late
years, in each of which the name of Lord Randal has become corrupted to
‘Tiranti.’</p>

<p>The antiphonetic form of the ballad is popular, as being dramatic and
suitable for singing. Compare <i>Edward</i>, also a dialogue between
mother and son.</p>

<h4 class = "chapter">LAMKIN</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> is from Jamieson’s
<i>Popular Ballads</i>. He obtained it from Mrs. Brown. It is by far the
best version of a score or so in existence. The name of the hero varies
from Lamkin, Lankin, Lonkin, etc., to Rankin and Balcanqual. I&nbsp;have
been informed by Andrew McDowall, Esq., of an incomplete version in
which Lamkin’s name has become ‘Bold Hang’em.’</p>

<p>Finlay (<i>Scottish Ballads</i>) remarks:&mdash; ‘All reciters agree
that Lammikin, or Lambkin, is not the name of the hero, but merely an
epithet.’</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Story</span> varies little throughout
all the versions, though in some, as in one known to Percy, it lacks
much of the detail here given.</p>

<h4 class = "chapter">FAIR MARY OF WALLINGTON</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> is from <i>Lovely Jenny’s
Garland</i>, as given with emendations by Professor Child. There is also
a curiously perverted version in Herd’s manuscript, in which the verses
require rearrangement before becoming intelligible.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Story</span> can be gathered from the
version here given without much difficulty. It turns on the marriage of
Fair Mary, who is one of seven sisters fated to die of their first
child. Fair Mary seems to be a fatalist, and, after vowing never to
marry, accepts as her destiny the hand of Sir William Fenwick of
Wallington. Three-quarters of a year later she sends to fair Pudlington
for her mother. Her mother is much affected at the news (st.&nbsp;22),
and goes to Wallington. Her daughter, in travail, lays the blame on her,
cuts open her side to give birth to an heir, and dies.</p>

<p>In a Breton ballad Pontplancoat thrice marries a Marguerite, and each
of his three sons costs his mother her life.</p>

<p>In the Scottish ballad, a ‘scope’ is put in Mary’s mouth when the
operation takes place. In the Breton ballad it is a silver spoon or a
silver ball. ‘Scope,’ or ‘scobs’ as it appears in Herd, means a gag, and
was apparently used to prevent her from crying out. But the silver spoon
and ball in the Breton ballad would appear to have been used for
Marguerite to bite on in her anguish, just as sailors chewed bullets
while being flogged.</p>
